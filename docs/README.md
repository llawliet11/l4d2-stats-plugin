## Key System Concepts

### Configuration-Driven Design
- **All rules configurable**: Point values, penalties, and calculations defined in JSON
- **No hardcoded values**: Complete flexibility without code changes
- **Runtime updates**: Configuration changes supported with API restart

### Four-Tier Point System
- **Overall Points**: Global rankings across all maps
- **Map Points**: Map-specific rankings and performance
- **MVP All Time**: Global champion determination
- **MVP of Map**: Map-specific champion recognition

### Data Architecture
- **Three-table system**: `stats_users`, `stats_map_users`, `stats_games`
- **Map-based tracking**: Granular statistics with session information
- **Data integrity**: Foreign key relationships and validation

## Documentation Philosophy

### Knowledge-Focused Approach
- **Concepts over implementation**: Focus on understanding systems rather than specific code
- **Configuration emphasis**: Highlight configurable aspects and flexibility
- **Architectural understanding**: Explain how systems work together
- **Troubleshooting guidance**: Provide diagnostic and problem-solving information

### Documentation Standards
- **Markdown format**: Use `.md` files with clear structure
- **Clear headings**: Organize content with logical hierarchy
- **Cross-references**: Link related concepts and documents
- **Current information**: Keep content accurate and up-to-date
- **Practical examples**: Include relevant examples and scenarios

### Contributing Guidelines
1. **Focus on knowledge**: Document concepts, not implementation details
2. **Emphasize configuration**: Highlight configurable aspects
3. **Update cross-references**: Maintain links between related documents
4. **Keep current**: Update information when systems change
