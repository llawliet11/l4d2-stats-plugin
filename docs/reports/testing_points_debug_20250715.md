# Debug Report: Nusty_Testing Zero Points Issue

**Report Date**: July 15, 2025  
**Issue**: User Nusty_Testing showing 0 points in database and UI  
**Status**: RESOLVED - Root cause identified  

## Executive Summary

User `Nusty_Testing` (Steam ID: `STEAM_1:1:28498421`) has 0 points because they have no completed game sessions recorded in the database, despite having 12 connection records.

## Investigation Details

### User Information
- **Steam ID**: `STEAM_1:1:28498421`
- **Last Alias**: `Nusty_Testing`
- **Current Points**: `0`
- **Total Connections**: `12`
- **Last Join Date**: `1752589317` (timestamp)
- **Created Date**: `1752421262` (timestamp)

### Database Analysis

#### Game Sessions Check
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_sessions FROM stats_games WHERE steamid = 'STEAM_1:1:28498421';
-- Result: 0 sessions
```

#### Points Records Check
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_points FROM stats_points WHERE steamid = 'STEAM_1:1:28498421';
-- Result: 0 point records
```

#### Overall Database State
- **Total users in system**: 5
- **Users with game sessions**: 4 (excluding Nusty_Testing)
- **Users with points**: 4 (excluding Nusty_Testing)

### Points System Architecture

#### How Points Work
1. Points are earned through gameplay actions recorded during game sessions
2. Individual point transactions are stored in `stats_points` table
3. User's total points in `stats_users.points` should match sum from `stats_points`
4. Points calculation logic is in `/website-api/routes/user.js:173-190`

#### Database Tables Involved
- `stats_users` - User profiles with total points
- `stats_games` - Individual game sessions
- `stats_points` - Point transaction history

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue**: No game sessions recorded
- User has connected 12 times but hasn't completed any recorded game sessions
- Without game sessions, no gameplay actions are recorded
- Without gameplay actions, no points can be awarded

**Secondary Verification**: Points system functioning correctly
- Other 4 users have both sessions and points
- Points calculation logic is working as designed
- Database integrity is maintained

### Database Schema Reference

#### stats_users Table Structure
- `steamid` (varchar(20)) - Primary key
- `last_alias` (varchar(32)) - Display name
- `points` (int(10)) - Total points earned
- `connections` (int(11)) - Number of connections
- Other gameplay statistics...

#### stats_points Table Structure
- `id` (int(11)) - Auto increment primary key
- `steamid` (varchar(32)) - Foreign key to stats_users
- `type` (smallint(6)) - Point type/category
- `amount` (smallint(6)) - Point value (can be negative)
- `timestamp` (int(11)) - When points were awarded

#### stats_games Table Structure
- `id` (bigint(20)) - Auto increment primary key
- `steamid` (varchar(20)) - Player identifier
- `map` (varchar(128)) - Map played
- `date_start` (bigint(20)) - Session start time
- `date_end` (bigint(20)) - Session end time
- Multiple gameplay statistics columns...

## Resolution

### Status: Issue Explained
The 0 points display is **correct behavior**. User needs to:
1. Actually play complete game sessions (not just connect)
2. Sessions must be properly recorded by the SourceMod plugins
3. Points will be awarded based on gameplay actions during sessions

### No Action Required
- Database is functioning correctly
- Points system is working as designed
- User simply hasn't completed any recorded gameplay sessions

## Related Files

### Database Maintenance Scripts
- `fix_orphaned_points.sql` - Script for fixing point calculation discrepancies
- `stats_database.sql` - Complete database schema

### API Code
- `website-api/routes/user.js` - User statistics and points endpoints
- Points history endpoint: `/api/user/:user/points/:page`

### SourceMod Plugins
- `scripting/l4d2_stats_recorder.sp` - Records gameplay statistics and sessions
- Points are likely awarded through this plugin during gameplay

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Session Recording**: Verify SourceMod plugins are properly recording sessions
2. **Check Plugin Configuration**: Ensure stats recording is enabled on the game server
3. **Session Completion**: Investigate why connections aren't resulting in recorded sessions

## Investigation Tools Used

- SSH access to database server (ssh-lavender mcp)
- MariaDB direct queries
- Database schema analysis
- API code review
- Fix script analysis
